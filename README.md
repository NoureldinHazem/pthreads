# pthreads
It is required to implement two popular algorithms as multi-threaded ones.</br>
They are as follows:
1) Matrix Multiplication
</br>It is required to implement two variations of this algorithm:</br>
a. The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread.</br>
b. The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread.</br>
2) Merge Sort</br>
Merge sort is an O (n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm. It is a divide and
conquers algorithm. Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:</br>
If the list is of length 0 or 1, then it is already sorted. Otherwise:</br>
a. Divide the unsorted list into two sub-lists of about half the size.</br>
b. Sort each sub-list recursively by re-applying the merge sort.</br>
c. Merge the two sub-lists back into one sorted list</br></br>
This was assignment 2 in OS course
